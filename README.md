The molecular landscape of dermal neurofibromatosis
===============
This project is focused on analyzing the molecular landscape of dermal NF and is
funded by the Children's Tumor Foundation.  All available data and key analysis
steps uploaded to http://www.synapse.org/dermalNF


Types of Data
-------------

This project contains diverse types of high-throughput data. Links to the
analysis of each type of data can be found here:
* Copy Number Alteration data from SNP OMNI Arrays
* Whole Genome Sequencing
* RNA-Sequencing
* iTRAQ Proteomics

Binaries used to process this data can be found in [the binaries directory](./bin/) while specific
analytical tasks can be found in [the analysis directory](./analysis).
